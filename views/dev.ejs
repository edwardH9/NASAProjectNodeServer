        <div class="textBody">
        <p class="summaryP">The Multipurpose Extreme Environment Drone Rover Hybrid (MEEDRH) is designed to explore areas around the world that humans wouldn't survive in.</p> 
            <p>To match this goal, the MEEDRH has specifications such as the ability survive extremely high temperatures of up to 1250Â°C.
            To meet this specification, the MEEDRH uses passive and active cooling technology to respond intelligently to the environment that 
            the mission site will present. While the MEEDRH has standard obstacle avoidance and self-driving capabilities, this unit is no ordinary autonomous vehicle. </p>
            <br>
            <p>The MEEDRH is <b>both</b> a land based vehicle ("rover") and an air based vehicle ("drone") in one unit.</p>
            <br>
            
            <h3>Land Based Unit ("Rover")</h3>

            <p class="indentP">The rover's electrical communications are handled by the Raspberry Pi single board computer. This unit handles the autonomous navigation features of the MEEDRH and 
            also actively collects data in real time during deployment. The rover has the following capabilities:</p>
            <ul> Capabilties during operation:
                <li>Remote excavation of earth samples</li>
                <li>Passive data collection on variables such as ambient temperature, mission uptime, system diagnostics, etc</li>
                <li>Ability to record surveillance or take still images (both continously and in set time intervals)</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p class="indentP">The data that the rover gathers is stored locally until the mission is finished and the unit returns back to it's home base. On connection to a known network, the rover has the ability to upload data collected
            during a mission to another part of the project, the MEEDRH server. The server has been programmed to interface directly with 
            it's own database and the Raspberry Pi seamlessly. The server offers the following functionalities:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Database integration to store all mission data</li>
                <li>Authentication based permissions</li>
                <li>Asynchronous design (Ability to process multiple requests simultaneously)</li>
                <li>Ability to broadcast data throughout a secure network (specifically useful for the camera feed's of the drone and rover)</li>
                <li>Pre-configured API to allow public access to the MEEDRH's missions and data</li>
            </ul>
            
            </p>
            <p class="indentP">
                On the inside, the MEEDRH uses intelligent circuit design to protect all electronic hardware. One aspect of this design is the implementation of 
                standalone power supplies for the onboard sensors. Avoiding using the Pi as a power supply yields greater performance and more reliable launches overall. The rover will
                have obscurable solar panels and modified integrated circuits that can charge these power supplies, even during deployment. 
            </p>
        </p>
        <h3>Air Based Unit ("Drone")</h3>
        <p class="indentP">
            The drone is stationed on the top interior panel of the rover. The drone is held electromagnetically to the rover's frame until the Raspberry Pi receives the 
            request to deploy the drone. Once deployed, the drone uses an onboard camera to create a live feed of what it sees. Simultaneous with the camera's activation, 
            other microcontrollers on the drone instantiate a WiFi connection and stream the camera feed to a page on this network. Through this access point, any mission personnel
            can monitor the progress of the mission in real time. On the same page as the camera feed, there is a graphical user interface that will allow a designated
            pilot to remotely control the drone's movement. The drone was designed to fly directly inside a volcano and collect samples from the inside.
            In all, the drone has the following capabilities:
            <ul>
                <li>Excavation of volcanic matter</li>
                <li>Onboard storage of harvested samples</li>
                <li>Transportation and injection of preloaded substances into the volcano</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
            <br>
        <h3>Closing</h3>
        <p class="indentP">
            The MEEDRH has unlimited potential and is unlike any other attempt at a multipurpose autonomous vehicle. There are more capabilities that can be added to
            this vehicle including implementation of artificial intelligence, higher strength motors and drivers, more durable materials, and larger carrying capacity
            for the drone. There were more capabilities planned for this unit, however, funding for materials has not arrived. If the budget was expanded, the funds were transferred
            quicker, and the materials were delivered sooner, this project would be the greatest project the program would ever see.
